# DoubleIntegralCalculator
A program (GUI) that solves double integrals.

A very self-explanatory program.
You input your double integral with respect to x and y (DxDy) or (DyDx).
When you finish inputting the double integral, it will give you the answer and also show a graph of the x and y coordinates for the integral.

NOTE: When entering all inputs for the program you have to specify when you are going to multiply, divide, add, subtract, and raise to the power.

for multiplication use: *
for division use: /
for addition use: +
for subtraction use: -
for raising to the power use: ** NOT: ^

EXAMPLES: 
DO NOT WRITE: 5x+5y
DO WRITE: 5*x+5*y

DO NOT WRITE 5x^3+3y
DO WRITE: 5*x**3+3*y
